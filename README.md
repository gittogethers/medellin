## Welcome!

We are thrilled that you are joining GitHub as a community leader and look forward to the energy and experience you will bring to our group. Let's continue to make open-source technology accessible, enjoyable, and successful!

## GitHub Community Leader Mission

The GitHub Community Leaders Program is a community initiative to enable individuals and their local communities to grow with Open Source and GitHub.

## About the Communities
GitHub's open-source communities are groups of developers in a specific city or region, who participate by attending events, organizing "GitTogethers," participating in live streams, sharing knowledge, and fostering collaboration.
